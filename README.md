**AIR CANVAS AND SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION SYSTEM**/ Python, OpenCv, MediaPipe 2024

Writing in the air, a key area in image processing, advances automation and man-machine interfaces. This project develops a motion-to-text converter for wearable devices, using computer vision to trace finger movements. The generated text can be used for messages and emails, offering a communication tool for the deaf and reducing the need for mobile and laptop usage.
